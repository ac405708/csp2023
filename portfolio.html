        <td>This is my rendition of "Spectrum V" By Ellsworth Kelly. I created this in CSS. This was made for an assignment given to me for my Computer Science course which I completed using Replit. After I was done with the basic code I stylized it using a color design and found enticing on Coolors. Overall the project was fun and helped me build a better understanding on CSS. Original can be found below.	</td>
